# â˜• Java Projects

Welcome to my Java projects repository! Here you will find a collection of applications and exercises developed to practice and demonstrate my knowledge in Java programming. Each project is structured, commented, and focused on solving real-world problems through object-oriented logic and clean code.

## ðŸ§  Projects Overview:

A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Includes input validation and interaction via console.  
âœ… Input validation  
âœ… Loop for multiple operations  
âœ… Clear and user-friendly interface  

### ðŸ”¹ Temperature Converter
A console program that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.  
âœ… Validates user name and temperature input  
âœ… Applies temperature conversion formula  
âœ… Friendly user interaction  

### ðŸ”¹ BMI Calculator
Calculates Body Mass Index based on user's height and weight.  
âœ… Calculates and classifies BMI  
âœ… Handles invalid input  
âœ… Clean, modular code  

### ðŸ”¹ Banking System (Challenge)
Simulates a basic banking system where the user can deposit, withdraw, check balance, and exit the application.  
âœ… Simulated terminal banking interface  
âœ… Simple logic with if/switch-case  
âœ… Code designed with clarity and readability
